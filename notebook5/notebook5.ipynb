    "## 1. What is Algorithmic Bias?<a id='0'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The term 'bias,\"has a number of meanings that depend upon the context in which it is used. When we describe a person or a situation to be biased, we usually mean that that person or situation favors one thing, person or group over another. Frequently, this favor or prejudice is deemed unfair, thus bias in common parlance can take on a negative weight. In statistics, bias (of an estimator) is defined as \"the difference between this estimator's expected value and the true value of the parameter being estimated.\" Recently, people have identified bias in algorithmic models. **Algorithmic bias** refers to algorithmic models that systematically and unfairly discriminate against certain individuals or groups in favor of others. The concept of \"algorithmic bias\" is provocative because people tend to think of algorithmic systems as \"neutral\" and \"objective.\" Researchers have discovered biases in algorithmic models that [produce search engine results](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/02/26/3299/meet-the-woman-who-searches-out-search-engines-bias-against-women-and-minorities/), [underpin social media platforms](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53498685), [screen resumes](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G), determine mortgages, and [support health care decisions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/sports/football/nfl-concussion-racial-bias.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "From [*Bias in Computer Systems* by Friedman and Nissenbaum](https://nissenbaum.tech.cornell.edu/papers/biasincomputers.pdf), bias arises in three primary ways in computer systems: \n",
    "- **Preexisting bias** arises when computer systems embody biases that exist independently of the system and usually prior to its creation, then perpetuates the preexisting bias. It can creep into a system through conscious and explicit efforts of individuals or institutions, or unconsciously despite good intentions.\n",
    "- **Technical bias** arises from system constraints or technical considerations, such as hardware limitation, random number generation, or even making human constructs usable by a computer (quantifying qualitative data for example).\n",
    "- **Emergent bias** emerges in the context of use after the system has been designed. \n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively manage patients, health systems often need to estimate particular patients' health risks, or the likelihood that a patient will develop certain types of medical conditions in the future. Quantitative measures, or \"risk scores,\" can help health care providers to prioritize patients for certain kinds of treatments and preventive interventions, helping them to allocate resources to patients who need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we examine an algorithm widely-used in the health care industry to establish quantitative risk scores for patients. This serves as a screening tool to alert primary care doctors to high-risk patients. This algorithm uses medical cost (i.e., the amount that a patient's medical treatments cost) as a proxy for health. Through analysis of the data used in the model, we will discover how this algorithm embeds a bias against Black patients, undervaluing their medical risk relative to White patients: given the same risk score, Black patients are sicker than White patients. Crucially, this bias is not immediately visible when comparing medical costs across White and Black patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll follow similar steps taken in the paper to uncover bias in this particular health risk algorithm by decomposing the variables in relation to the calculated risk scores. The key insight of Obermeyer et al's work is that bias frequently slips into algorithmic systems unnoticed, particularly when sensitive characteristics (such as race) are omitted or backgrounded in the data science process. Bias in algorithms affects people's lives very concretely: it makes it more difficult for Black patients to receive the care they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "## 2. Medical Cost and Risk <a id='1'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "To help hospitals and insurance companies identify patients who should qualify for “high-risk care management” programs, the algorithm assigns each patient a risk score from 0 to 100. It predicts a patient’s total medical expenditure based on data from insurance claims (age, sex, diagnosis codes, etc.) and uses this variable as a proxy for health care needs.  Patient risk scores are then generated as functions of their predicted expenditures. For example, a patient with a calculated risk score of 80 has a predicted cost of 126,600 and a patient with a calculated risk score of .4 has a predicted cost of 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model is calibrated (adjusted so the predictions match the empirical data) across race in terms of risk score and expenditure, Black and White patients with a given risk score should have similar total medical expenditures, on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see if this is true, we will generate a graph that shows the mean total medical expenditure by race given a risk score percentile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to load the data the model uses."

    "\n",
    "Even systems that appear balanced across racial groups at first glance may belie underlying biases in the datasets. Thus, seemingly unbiased predictors, such as cost, can in fact be highly correlated with a biasing variable such as race, gender, income or other relational characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, bias emerged from using an indicator of need (cost) that was itself influenced by race. Biased estimation of need between races resulted.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the ways in which race influences health care cost, here is a segment from Obermeyer et al’s paper:\n",
    " \n",
    ">The literature broadly suggests two main potential channels [through which racial discrepancies in healthcare cost are created]. **First, poor patients face substantial barriers to accessing health care, even when enrolled in insurance plans.** Although the population we study is entirely insured, there are many other mechanisms by which poverty can lead to disparities in use of health care: geography and differential access to transportation, competing demands from jobs or child care, or knowledge of reasons to seek care (1-3). To the extent that race and socioeconomic status are correlated, these factors will differentially affect Black patients. **Second, race could affect costs directly via several channels: direct (“taste-based”) discrimination, changes to the doctor–patient relationship, or others.** A recent trial randomly assigned Black patients to a Black or White primary care provider and found significantly higher uptake of recommended preventive care when the provider was Black (4). This is perhaps the most rigorous demonstration of this effect, and it fits with a larger literature on potential mechanisms by which race can affect health care directly. For example, it has long been documented that Black patients have reduced trust in the health care system (5), a fact that some studies trace to the revelations of the Tuskegee study and other adverse experiences (6). A substantial literature in psychology has documented physicians’ differential perceptions of Black patients, in terms of intelligence, affiliation (7), or pain tolerance (8). **Thus, whether it is communication, trust, or bias, something about the interactions of Black patients with the health care system itself leads to reduced use of health care. The collective effect of these many channels is to lower health spending substantially for Black patients, conditional on need—a finding that has been appreciated for at least two decades (9, emphasis added).**"

    "Following up with the previous section, how could we use the data we have to create new proxies for health needs that may be less biased than medical costs? Obermeyer et al. suggested to keep the model infrastructure - the sample (data used), predictors (excluding race), training process, etc. - but changing the label. Instead of future cost, they created a variable that combined health prediction with cost prediction which resulted in an 84% reduction in bias. \n",
