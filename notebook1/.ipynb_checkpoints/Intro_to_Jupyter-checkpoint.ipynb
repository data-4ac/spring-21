Fernando Perez, a professor in the statistics department here at UC Berkeley, created IPython as a graduate student in 2001 and co-founded Project Jupyter in 2014. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though the Jupyter Notebook interface has been around for almost a decade, the first notebook interface, Mathematica, was released over 30 years ago in 1988. Other notebook interfaces have released since then, but none have gained as much traction as Jupyter Notebooks have. Starting in the early 2000s, open-source scientific tools were becoming more and more popular and with the widespread popularity of Jupyter, it's well on its way to becoming a standard for sharing research results."

    "Notebooks are used for *Literate programming*, a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in 1984, in which a programming language is accompanied with a documentation language, i.e. the computer program has an explanation in a natural language. This idea effectively treats software as works of literature so that humans can easily interpret the logic of the code, both for the writer and the reader. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter leverages this idea and enables users to create and share documents that contain code, visualizations, narrative text, equations, and rich media. Notebooks are multipurpose and can be used in any discipline. The notebook is like a laboratory notebook, but for computing. Researchers can write code to work with their data while supplementing their methods with explanations, analysis, or hypotheses. Notebooks are also used in education, as students and learners can actively engage and interact with the material."

    "### Notebooks in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "The way notebooks are formatted encourages exploration, allowing users to iteratively update code and document the results. In use cases such as data exploration and communication, notebooks excel. Science (and computational work in general) has become quite sophisticated: models are built upon experiments are conducted on large swaths of data, methods and results are abstracted away into symbols, and papers are full of technical jargon. A static document like a paper might not be sufficient to both effectively communicate a new discovery and allow someone else to discover it for themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "With proprietary software like Mathematica, users are supposed to trust the results returned and are unable to check the code. Jupyter fosters transparency and hence encourages reproducibility. Not only is the code behind the software is available for anyone to inspect or tinker with, but code in the notebooks can also be examined or re-run to reproduce any results. Theodore Gray, a member of Perez's group, said about notebooks, \"I think what they have is acceptance from the scientific community as a tool that is considered to be universal.\"\n"
